# <span style="font-size:larger;">Hyperparameter Optimization with GradientBoostingRegressor 🚀</span>

Welcome to my Hyperparameter Optimization project using the GradientBoostingRegressor algorithm! 🌟 In this project, I aimed to enhance the performance of the model by tuning hyperparameters to minimize the mean squared error.

## Overview:
- Implemented GradientBoostingRegressor for regression tasks 📈.
- Utilized GridSearchCV for an exhaustive search over a specified hyperparameter grid 🔍.
- Objective: Minimize squared error to improve model accuracy and generalization 🎯.

## Key Components:
1. **Code:**
   - The main script (`Hyperparameter_optimization.ipyn`) contains the implementation of GradientBoostingRegressor and GridSearchCV.

2. **Dataset:**
   - Used the famous temperature dataset to test the regressions.
   
3. **Results:**
   - The project includes results and metrics to showcase the performance improvement achieved through hyperparameter tuning.
